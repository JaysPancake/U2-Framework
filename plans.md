# FiveM Roleplay Framework Project Outline

## Project Overview

Our project is to create a customizable, high-performance roleplay framework for FiveM servers. This framework will provide server owners with the tools they need to create immersive and engaging roleplay experiences for their players.

## Project Plan

### 1. Requirements Gathering - âœ”

We will begin the project by gathering requirements from server owners and players to identify the key features and functionality that are important for a roleplay framework.

### 2. Architecture Design - âœ”

Based on the requirements gathered in the first step, we will design the architecture of the framework, including the data structures, APIs, and user interfaces. We will also identify any third-party libraries or tools that may be required.

### 3. Implementation - ðŸ”§ We are here. ðŸ”§

We will then begin implementing the framework, starting with the core functionality and building out additional features as we go. We will use an iterative development process, with regular feedback from server owners and players to ensure that the framework is meeting their needs.

### 4. Testing - ðŸ”–

Throughout the implementation phase, we will conduct extensive testing to ensure that the framework is stable, scalable, and performs well under load. We will use automated testing tools to identify and fix bugs as early in the development process as possible.

### 5. Documentation - ðŸ”–

Once the framework is complete, we will create comprehensive documentation that outlines the features and functionality of the framework, as well as how to use it and customize it for different server setups.

### 6. Release - ðŸ”–

Finally, we will release the framework to the FiveM community, making it available for download and providing support to server owners who are using the framework.

## Conclusion

Our goal with this project is to create a high-quality, flexible, and easy-to-use roleplay framework for FiveM servers. By following the steps outlined above, we believe we can create a framework that meets the needs of server owners and players alike, and helps to foster a vibrant and engaging roleplay community within the FiveM ecosystem.
